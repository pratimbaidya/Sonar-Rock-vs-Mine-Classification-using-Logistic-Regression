# Sonar Data Classification (Rock vs Mine) using Logistic Regression

## About the Dataset

### Context
The objective of this project is to classify sonar data to differentiate between rocks and mines using machine learning techniques. Sonar data, collected through sound waves, is processed to detect underwater objects. Machine learning models can analyze this data to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine.

### Content of the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sonar.all-data.csv, which contains sonar signals data collected to distinguish between rocks and mines.
* This data is essential for training machine learning models that can predict whether a sonar reading corresponds to a rock or a mine.
* The dataset consists of 60 numerical feature columns followed by a class label column.
* Each feature represents a measurement from the sonar signals, and the class label indicates whether the reading corresponds to a rock (R) or a mine (M).

## Approch
1. EDA - Understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing - Prepare the dataset for machine learning models.
3. Model Development - Train and evaluate machine learning model(Logistic Regression) to classify sonar data.
4. Model Evaluation - Check the performance of the trained model.
